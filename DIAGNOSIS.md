- **Fix**: Added `types` array with required type definitions

### 5. Playwright TLS Bypass
- **Issue**: No controlled TLS bypass mechanism for Playwright
- **Fix**: Added `launchBrowser` function with environment-controlled TLS bypass

### 6. Jest Types
- **Issue**: Missing Jest types in js-core library
- **Fix**: Added Jest types to js-core `tsconfig.json` (already present) and devDependencies

### 7. cSpell Noise
- **Issue**: Excessive noise in spell checking for test files
- **Fix**: Added regex overrides to reduce noise in test files

### 8. Git Ignore
- **Issue**: Incomplete `.gitignore` configuration
- **Fix**: Added missing entries for common build artifacts

### 9. Python Tooling
- **Issue**: Missing ruff and mypy configuration
- **Fix**: Added configuration to `pyproject.toml`

### 10. Python Code Issues
- **Issue**: Unused import and module-level import in `schema.py`
- **Fix**: Removed unused import and moved module-level import to top

### 11. Crawlee MCP Integration
- **Issue**: Missing robust crawling capabilities with autoscaling, retries, and proxy support
- **Fix**: Added `@argus/runner-crawlee` workspace with PlaywrightCrawler integration

### 12. Production Hardening
- **Issue**: Missing stable review IDs, rate limiting, robots.txt compliance, and duplication detection
- **Fix**: Added review ID generation, rate limiting, robots.txt compliance, and duplication detection

## Root Cause Analysis

| Category | Issue | Root Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|------------|----------|
| Configuration | Line ending inconsistencies | Missing standardization | Updated `.gitattributes` and `.editorconfig` |
| Build | Workspace resolution issues | Incomplete workspace globs | Updated `pnpm-workspace.yaml` |
| Scripts | Poor error handling | Missing concurrency control | Updated root `package.json` |
| Type Safety | Missing type definitions | Incomplete tsconfig | Updated `tsconfig.json` files |
| Security | No TLS bypass control | Hardcoded security settings | Added env-controlled bypass |
| Testing | Lint noise in tests | Overly strict spell checking | Added test file overrides |
| Python | Tooling gaps | Missing configuration | Added ruff/mypy config |
| Python | Code quality issues | Unused imports | Removed unused imports |
| Crawlee | Missing robust crawling | No autoscaling/retry/proxy support | Added `@argus/runner-crawlee` workspace |
| Production | Missing hardening features | No ID stability, rate limiting, robots compliance | Added review ID, rate limiting, robots compliance |

## Before/After Comparison

### Build Reproducibility
- **Before**: Inconsistent builds due to line ending issues
- **After**: Consistent builds with standardized line endings

### Typing Cleanliness
- **Before**: Missing type definitions causing build warnings
- **After**: Complete type definitions for all modules

### Lint Debt
- **Before**: High lint noise in test files
- **After**: Reduced noise with targeted overrides

### Test Pass Rate
- **Before**: Tests passing but with excessive lint warnings
- **After**: Cleaner test output with reduced noise

### Developer Experience
- **Before**: Inconsistent editor behavior across platforms
- **After**: Standardized editor behavior

### CI Pipeline Health
- **Before**: Potential failures due to workspace resolution issues
- **After**: Stable CI with proper workspace configuration

### Crawlee Integration
- **Before**: Limited crawling capabilities with no autoscaling or proxy support
- **After**: Robust crawling with autoscaling, retries, and proxy support via Crawlee

### Production Hardening
- **Before**: No stable review IDs, rate limiting, robots compliance, or duplication detection
- **After**: Stable review IDs, rate limiting, robots compliance, and duplication detection

## Production Hardening Features

The following production hardening features have been implemented:

### Stable Review IDs and Deduplication
- Each review is assigned a stable ID based on its content to prevent duplicates
- Automatic deduplication in the extraction pipeline
- Works in both browser (userscript) and Node.js (Crawlee) environments

### Rate Limiting and Exponential Backoff
- Configurable delays and jitter between requests to avoid overwhelming servers
- Exponential backoff for 429 and 5xx errors
- Environment variables for fine-tuning: `ARGUS_DELAY_MS`, `ARGUS_JITTER_MS`, `ARGUS_BACKOFF_BASE_MS`

### Robots.txt Compliance
- Respects robots.txt by default with override option for testing
- Environment variables: `ARGUS_ROBOTS_RESPECT`, `ARGUS_OVERRIDE`
- Soft-fail behavior with warnings when disallowed

### MCP UI Drift Detection
- Automated accessibility tree and outerHTML capture
- Selector suggestion for different locales
- Playbook for UI drift detection and handling

### Load Testing and Duplication Detection
- Real-world load testing scenarios
- Duplication rate verification (< 1%)
- Performance budgets enforcement (p95 < 3.5s)

### CI/CD Integration
- Budgets job in CI workflow to enforce performance and duplication limits
- Automated testing of all production hardening features
- Comprehensive documentation of all features and environment variables

## Recommendations

1. **Ongoing Maintenance**: Regularly review and update workspace configurations as new packages are added
2. **Documentation**: Update developer documentation to reflect new environment variables for TLS bypass
3. **Monitoring**: Monitor CI pipeline for any regressions after these changes
4. **Testing**: Continue to expand test coverage for all modules
5. **Crawlee**: Monitor crawlee integration for performance and reliability improvements
6. **Production Hardening**: Monitor the effectiveness of the new hardening features and adjust as needed
