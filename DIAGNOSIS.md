8. **Security**: Address the low severity vulnerability identified by pnpm audit

## E2E Triage Automation

### Problem
Flaky tests can cause CI instability and make it difficult to identify genuine issues. Without automated triage, test stability tags need to be manually updated, which is time-consuming and error-prone.

### Solution
Implemented an automated triage system that:
1. Tracks test performance history in a rolling window
2. Automatically promotes stable tests to [stable] tag
3. Automatically demotes flaky tests to [quarantine] tag
4. Commits tag updates automatically in CI

### Implementation Details
- **Promotion Criteria**: Tests are promoted to [stable] if they pass ≥98% in the last 10 runs
- **Demotion Criteria**: Tests are demoted to [quarantine] if they fail ≥2 times in the last 3 runs
- **History Tracking**: Test results are tracked in `apps/e2e/reports/history.json` with a rolling window of 10 runs
- **Automatic Tag Updates**: The system automatically updates test tags in the spec files based on the triage decisions

### Files
- `apps/e2e/playwright.config.ts`: Configured to output JSON reports to `apps/e2e/reports/results.json`
- `tools/e2e/triage.ts`: Main triage script that processes test results and updates tags
- `apps/e2e/reports/history.json`: Test history tracking with rolling window
- `apps/e2e/reports/results.json`: Latest test results from Playwright

### Commands
- Run tests and generate report: `pnpm run e2e:report`
- Run triage: `pnpm run e2e:triage`

### CI Integration
- Nightly runs process all tests and update tags automatically
- Changes are committed back to the repository with the message "chore(e2e): auto-triage tags"

### Results
- Successfully implemented automated test triage system
- Created robust tagging system that only updates SIM#/REAL# test lines
- Implemented CI workflow updates with artifact uploading and automatic commits
- Added comprehensive documentation for the new functionality

   - Automatic issue creation if SLOs are violated

2. **Release Process**:
   - RC→GA promotion when pass-rate [stable] ≥95% for 3 consecutive days
   - Automated tagging with v0.1.0

3. **Operational Jobs**:
