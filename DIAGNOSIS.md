### License Compliance
- License checker found 2 Apache-2.0, 1 ISC, and 1 MIT licensed dependencies
- All licenses are permissive and compliant with open source standards

### Mutation Testing
- Stryker configuration added for future mutation testing
- Mutation testing not yet run due to complexity of existing test suite

## Production Hardening Features

The following production hardening features have been implemented:

### Stable Review IDs and Deduplication
- Each review is assigned a stable ID based on its content to prevent duplicates
- Automatic deduplication in the extraction pipeline
- Works in both browser (userscript) and Node.js (Crawlee) environments

### Rate Limiting and Exponential Backoff
- Configurable delays and jitter between requests to avoid overwhelming servers
- Exponential backoff for 429 and 5xx errors
- Environment variables for fine-tuning: `ARGUS_DELAY_MS`, `ARGUS_JITTER_MS`, `ARGUS_BACKOFF_BASE_MS`

### Robots.txt Compliance
- Respects robots.txt by default with override option for testing
- Environment variables: `ARGUS_ROBOTS_RESPECT`, `ARGUS_OVERRIDE`
- Soft-fail behavior with warnings when disallowed

### MCP UI Drift Detection
- Automated accessibility tree and outerHTML capture
- Selector suggestion for different locales
- Playbook for UI drift detection and handling

### Load Testing and Duplication Detection
- Real-world load testing scenarios
- Duplication rate verification (< 1%)
- Performance budgets enforcement (p95 < 3.5s)

### CI/CD Integration
- Budgets job in CI workflow to enforce performance and duplication limits
- Automated testing of all production hardening features
- Comprehensive documentation of all features and environment variables

## Recommendations

1. **Ongoing Maintenance**: Regularly review and update workspace configurations as new packages are added
2. **Documentation**: Update developer documentation to reflect new environment variables for TLS bypass
3. **Monitoring**: Monitor CI pipeline for any regressions after these changes
4. **Testing**: Continue to expand test coverage for all modules
5. **Crawlee**: Monitor crawlee integration for performance and reliability improvements
6. **Production Hardening**: Monitor the effectiveness of the new hardening features and adjust as needed
7. **QA Infrastructure**: Continue to refine and improve the QA infrastructure, addressing the unused files and dependencies identified by knip and depcheck
8. **Security**: Address the low severity vulnerability identified by pnpm audit
