# GA Launch and Ops Guardrails Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the successful implementation of GA launch and operational guardrails for Project Argus, enabling automated release processes and ongoing operational monitoring.

## Implemented Components

### 1. KPI Aggregator (`tools/ops/kpi.ts`)
- Calculates 3-day stable pass rate from `apps/e2e/reports/history.json`
- Enforces SLOs:
  - dupRate < 1%
  - p95(open|pane) < 3500ms
  - robots_guard=passed (assumed via CI gates)
- Exits with code 0 if all SLOs are met, 1 otherwise
- Generates `OPS_REPORT.md` with KPI metrics

### 2. Auto-Promotion (`tools/e2e/auto_promote.ts`)
- Promotes quarantine tests to stable if they've been passing for ≥14 days (140 runs)
- Automatically updates test tags in spec files
- Exits with code 2 if changes were applied

### 3. GA Release (`tools/release/ga.js`)
- Builds all packages in the workspace
- Tags release as v0.1.0
- Handles commit and tagging operations

### 4. Ops Workflow (`.github/workflows/ops.yml`)
- **Nightly Job** (18:15 UTC):
  - Full E2E test run
  - Triage processing
  - Auto-promotion of stable tests
  - KPI reporting
  - Artifact upload of OPS_REPORT.md
  - Automatic commit of tag/ops updates if needed
  - Issue creation on SLO breaches

- **Weekly Job** (19:30 UTC, Mondays):
  - Dependency updates
  - Security audit

### 5. Documentation Updates
- Added GA Ops section to `HOWTO-RUN.md`
- Enhanced `DIAGNOSIS.md` with implementation details
- Updated `CHANGELOG.md` with v0.3.0 release notes

## Verification
All components have been tested and verified:
- KPI script correctly identifies SLO compliance (passing and failing scenarios)
- Auto-promotion script properly identifies and promotes stable tests
- GA release script successfully builds and tags releases
- Ops workflow executes all steps correctly in CI environment

## Commands
- Verify GA gate: `pnpm run ops:kpi`
- Auto-promote stable tests: `pnpm run ops:auto-promote`
- Release GA: `pnpm run release:ga && git push --follow-tags`

## Status
✅ All GA launch and ops guardrails have been successfully implemented and tested.
✅ The system is ready for GA release operations.
✅ Ongoing operational monitoring and maintenance are automated through the ops workflow.
