# Deadcode Consolidation Summary

## Tools Created

1. **tools/tidy/apply-deletions.js** - Handles moving files to attic or removing them
2. **tools/tidy/plan.mjs** - Combines knip/ts-prune/depcheck reports into DEADCODE_REPORT.json
3. **knip-ignore.json** - Safelists files needed for tests/fixtures
4. **tsprune-ignore.txt** - Safelists exports intentionally kept for public API or tests

## NPM Scripts Added

1. **tidy:plan** - Generates deadcode report from knip/ts-prune/depcheck
2. **tidy:apply** - Applies deadcode removal actions
3. **qa:strict** - Runs full QA suite with matrix testing

## CI Workflow Updated

Added `qa-strict` job to enforce quality gates after unit tests, coverage, and other quality scans.

## Deadcode Report

The DEADCODE_REPORT.json file contains a list of identified deadcode items with their paths, reasons (knip, ts-prune, depcheck), and actions (remove).

## Implementation Details

- The apply-deletions script can handle both "attic" (move to attic directory) and "remove" (delete) actions
- The attic directory is timestamped to keep track of when files were moved
- A README.md file is created in each attic directory for documentation
- The plan.mjs script handles parsing of knip, ts-prune, and depcheck output with proper error handling

## Files Processed

The deadcode consolidation process identified and handled multiple unused files across the workspace, including:
- Test implementation files
- Temporary scripts
- Unused source files
- Unused dependencies

## Next Steps

1. Continue fixing TypeScript errors in the scraper-playwright project
2. Run the full QA suite to ensure no regressions
3. Update documentation as needed
4. Monitor for any issues after deadcode removal
