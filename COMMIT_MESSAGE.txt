chore(tidy): apply deadcode consolidation tools and processes

- Created tools/tidy/apply-deletions.js to handle deadcode removal
- Created tools/tidy/plan.mjs to combine knip/ts-prune/depcheck reports
- Added knip-ignore.json and tsprune-ignore.txt for safelisting
- Updated package.json with tidy:plan, tidy:apply, and qa:strict scripts
- Updated CI workflow with qa-strict job
- Generated DEADCODE_REPORT.json with 29 items for removal
- Applied deadcode removal actions
- Created DIAGNOSIS.md entries for deadcode consolidation
- Added DEADCODE_CONSOLIDATION_SUMMARY.md documentation

This change implements the deadcode consolidation phase of the project,
providing tools to identify, categorize, and remove unused code while
maintaining safety through attic archiving and proper safelisting.
