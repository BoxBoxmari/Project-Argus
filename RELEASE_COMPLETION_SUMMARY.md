## ðŸš€ Ready for Release

### Release Execution
```bash
cd C:\Users\Admin\Downloads\argus_skeleton\argus
pnpm -r run typecheck && pnpm -r run build
pnpm run release:rc
git push origin --follow-tags
```

Or using PowerShell:
```powershell
.\scripts\release.ps1
```

### Post-Release Verification
```bash
pnpm run monitor:post-release
```

Or using PowerShell:
```powershell
.\scripts\verify-release.ps1
```

### Rollback (if needed)
```bash
node tools/release/rollback.js v0.1.0-rc.1
```

Or using PowerShell:
```powershell
.\scripts\rollback.ps1 v0.1.0-rc.1
```

## ðŸ“‹ Summary of Production Hardening Features

1. **Stable Review IDs and Deduplication**
   - Browser-compatible hash function that works in both userscript and Crawlee environments
   - Automatic deduplication in extraction pipeline
   - Verified through load testing with < 1% duplication rate

2. **Rate Limiting and Exponential Backoff**
   - Configurable delays with jitter (ARGUS_DELAY_MS, ARGUS_JITTER_MS)
   - Exponential backoff for error retries (ARGUS_BACKOFF_BASE_MS)
   - Integrated into Crawlee middleware with environment variable support

3. **Robots.txt Compliance**
   - Automatic robots.txt fetching and parsing
   - Respect for disallow rules by default (ARGUS_ROBOTS_RESPECT=1)
   - Override capability for testing (ARGUS_OVERRIDE=1) with warnings

4. **MCP UI Drift Detection**
   - Playbook for automated UI drift detection at [apps/userscript/tools/mcp-ui-drift.yaml](file:///c%3A/Users/Admin/Downloads/argus_skeleton/argus/apps/userscript/tools/mcp-ui-drift.yaml)
   - Selector mapping maintenance for locales in [apps/userscript/selector_map.json](file:///c%3A/Users/Admin/Downloads/argus_skeleton/argus/apps/userscript/selector_map.json)

5. **Load Testing and Duplication Detection**
   - Comprehensive load tests implemented in [apps/e2e/tests/load.real.spec.ts](file:///c%3A/Users/Admin/Downloads/argus_skeleton/argus/apps/e2e/tests/load.real.spec.ts)
   - Duplication rate verification (< 1%) with automated checking

6. **CI/CD Integration**
   - Budgets job in CI workflow to enforce performance and quality requirements
   - Automated testing of all features
   - Performance budget enforcement (p95 < 3.5s)
