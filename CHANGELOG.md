## Development Notes

### Breaking Changes

- **v0.2.0**: Complete repository restructuring - all file paths changed
- **v0.3.0**: New advanced queue system replaces simple scraping logic

### Migration Guide

- See `docs/migration-guide.md` for detailed migration instructions
- Use PowerShell scripts for automated setup and cleanup
- Follow new monorepo structure for development

### Testing

- Run `pnpm -w run test` for JavaScript/TypeScript tests
- Run `uv run pytest` in Python modules for Python tests
- Use `scripts/ps/setup.ps1` for environment setup

### Performance Considerations

- Queue system designed for high-throughput scenarios
- Autoscaling prevents resource exhaustion
- Rate limiting prevents service blocking
- NDJSON format enables streaming processing

### Security Features

- Domain isolation prevents cross-site interference
- Rate limiting prevents abuse
- Input validation via JSON schemas
- Secure error handling without information leakage
