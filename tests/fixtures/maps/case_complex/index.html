                            occasions. The pan-seared salmon was cooked to perfection, and the wine selection is
                            impressive. Service was attentive without being intrusive. Will definitely return for
                            anniversary dinners.</span>

                        <span class="MyEned">Visited here for a business dinner last week. The restaurant has a
                            sophisticated atmosphere that's perfect for professional meetings. Started with the seafood
                            appetizer platter - the oysters were fresh and the shrimp cocktail was well-prepared. For
                            the main course, I had the ribeye steak medium-rare, which was cooked exactly as requested.
                            The portion size was generous and the accompanying vegetables were perfectly seasoned. My
                            colleague ordered the lobster thermidor, which looked spectacular and she raved about the
                            flavor. The wine list is extensive, though prices are on the higher side. Service was
                            professional and timely. The only minor complaint would be that the noise level can get
                            quite high during peak hours, making conversation challenging. Overall, a solid choice for
                            special occasions or business dinners, though be prepared for premium pricing.</span>

                            advance for our anniversary. Upon arrival, we were seated at a cramped table near the
                            kitchen despite requesting a quiet spot. The appetizer took 45 minutes to arrive, and when
                            it did, the calamari was overcooked and rubbery. The main courses were lukewarm when served.
                            The server seemed overwhelmed and forgot our drink orders twice. For what we paid ($180 for
                            two people), we expected much better service and food quality.</span>

                            flavors and textures. The amuse-bouche set the tone perfectly. Each course built upon the
                            last, showcasing seasonal ingredients. The duck confit was outstanding - crispy skin, tender
                            meat, paired beautifully with the cherry gastrique. Wine pairings were spot-on. Service was
                            impeccable, with servers knowledgeable about each dish's preparation. Atmosphere strikes
                            perfect balance between elegant and comfortable. Pricing reflects the quality and
