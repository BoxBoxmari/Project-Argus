# Day-2 Ops Hardening and Data Governance Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the successful implementation of Day-2 operational hardening and data governance features for Project Argus, enabling automated maintenance, security scanning, and data retention policies.

## Implemented Components

### 1. Data Retention System (`tools/ops/retention.ts`)
- Automatic cleanup of expired datasets, reports, and artifacts
- Configurable TTL with default 14 days (override via `ARGUS_TTL_DAYS`)
- Targets directories:
  - `apps/scraper-playwright/datasets/datasets/default`
  - `apps/e2e/reports`
  - `apps/e2e/metrics`
  - `e2e-report`
- Generates `RETENTION_REPORT.md` with cleanup details

### 2. Security Hardening
- **Gitleaks Configuration** (`.gitleaks.toml`)
  - Custom configuration for secret scanning
  - Allowlist for fixtures and reports directories

- **Security Workflow** (`.github/workflows/security.yml`)
  - Weekly secret scanning via gitleaks
  - Weekly npm audit for production dependencies
  - Scheduled runs every Monday at 19:45 UTC

### 3. CI Optimization
- **Ops Workflow Updates** (`.github/workflows/ops.yml`)
  - Added retention script execution to nightly job
  - Added retention report artifact upload
  - Updated commit messages to include retention

### 4. Documentation Updates
- Added Data Retention & Security section to `HOWTO-RUN.md`
- Enhanced `DIAGNOSIS.md` with Day-2 Ops implementation details
- Updated `CHANGELOG.md` with v0.4.0 release notes (Unreleased)

## Verification
All components have been tested and verified:
- Retention script correctly identifies and removes expired files
- Gitleaks configuration properly excludes fixture and report directories
- Security workflow executes all steps correctly
- Ops workflow includes retention reporting
- Documentation updates are accurate and complete

## Commands
- Run data retention: `pnpm run ops:retention`
- Override TTL: `ARGUS_TTL_DAYS=30 pnpm run ops:retention`
- Verify GA gate: `pnpm run ops:kpi`
- Auto-promote stable tests: `pnpm run ops:auto-promote`

## Status
✅ All Day-2 Ops hardening and data governance features have been successfully implemented and tested.
✅ The system is ready for automated maintenance and security scanning.
✅ Data retention policies are enforced through the nightly ops workflow.
