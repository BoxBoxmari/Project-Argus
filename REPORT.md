# Repo maintenance report

## Summary
- added workspace inventory and cleanup plan
- normalized editor and ignore configurations
- aligned root package scripts for recursive tasks

## Assumptions
- existing branch `work` used instead of creating new branch
- deeper build fixes and CI setup deferred

## TODO
- add per-package `package.json` and TypeScript configs
- implement CI workflow and lint/type-check for all stacks
